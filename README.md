In this research, we have proposed a variation to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
(IPD) game with the desire to examine how cooperation will evolve among a
number of competing players whose main goal is to increase their individual
payoffs when uncertain partial information on the past actions of future opponents are acquired at a cost. 

This variation of the IPD model stems from practical applications in
the Business, Political Science as well as Sports field where having information
about the historical actions of your opponents play vital roles in decision making.
Hence, using simulation models and experiments developed in the JAVA programming
language and MATLAB, we intend to investigate how this variation
of the iterated prisoners dilemma will promote cooperation among agents. The
statistical and simulation experiment results will conrm our expectations that
this variation of the IPD game will promote cooperation in a competing environment
that has dierent strategies.
However, in the event of an unmet expectation, we hope to gain much insight
in order to consider other variations that will promote cooperation among competing
players.
